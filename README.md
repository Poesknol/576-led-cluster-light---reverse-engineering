# 576 led cluster light - reverse engineering
I bought this cluster lights from the Action in the Netherlands. i reverse engineered this cluster light so i can use it in home automation packages (Home Assistent / Domoticz).

There are 2 files in this repository:
config.ini - The hex values that are send to the cluster light to turn it on or of or change the mode. 
clusterlights.py - A simple Python script to send the hex values to the cluster lights. 

TODO HOW TO USE IT
